## Project Description
1) Name of Project: Brewvana, web dictionary of beer industry

2) Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal: User can navigate the information about beer from API in single-page webapp environment.

3) List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

4) User can search/select beer by ABV or IBU or Hop, malt, yeast and etc....

5) User can see the details of each beer based on API information including image and short description.

6) PUNK API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2), React.js, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript, Chart.js, Python for web crawler
To make sure everyone can access the API reliably, each IP that makes a request has a rate limit of 3600 requests per hour.

This works out at 1 req/sec. This is an initial figure, if the servers hold up I will definitely consider bumping this number. You can see what the rate limit is and how many requests are remaining by looking at the rate limit headers sent in the response.

7) Chart for ABV/IBU of every beer in API

8) Interface with WebCrawler for each beer using python (https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-skills-web-scraping-javascript-using-python-97a29738353f)
