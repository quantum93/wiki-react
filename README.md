![Main Page](/public/screenshot.png)

## Project Description
Brewvana presents beer information from public API of brewerydb.com using React.js framework. It checks list of beer in API and display of beer's various information such as ABV, IBU, short description, and food pairing. It gives analysis of current API data itself such as data deposition activity, diversity of beer type and scattering chart of ABV vs. IBU information.

* Name of Project: Brewvana, web dictionary of beer industry
* Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal: User can navigate the information about beer from API in single-page webapp environment.
* User can search/select beer by ABV or IBU or Hop, malt, yeast and etc....
* User can see the details of each beer based on API information including image and short description.
* http://api.react.beer/v2 (move permanently http://www.brewerydb.com/developers) is API for this app.
* Due to the limit of API access, chart in app is based on local json storage of API information. Please check the update in future (/src/components/db.json).
