            "description": "When Ben the laughing dog was much younger, he developed a habit of sticking his nose in people’s crotches to check them out and say Hello. One of his favorite people to do this to coined the term CSB (or, “Crotch Sniffing Bastard”) and so the seed was planted for the name of this beer. A British style ESB with an Laughing Dog twist, it is crisp but malty and at the same time somewhat playful, it is a great beer to have while out sniffing around, or if you are stuck at home on the short leash for maybe sniffing in the wrong places.",

American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong.
